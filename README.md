# Binary Search Tree Visualization

A simple interactive visualization tool for understanding how Binary Search Trees (BST) work. This project is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** by **Badie Bahida**.

## 🌳 Features

- Insert nodes into the binary search tree
- Visual representation of the tree structure
- Animated node placement
- Search for a specific value with highlight
- Reset/clear the entire tree
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No installation required! Just open the HTML file in any modern web browser.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/badie16/bst-visualization.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash   
cd bst-visualization
```
Open the index.html file in your browser:
```bash   
start index.html
```
Or simply double-click index.html.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Page structure
CSS – Styling and layout
JavaScript – Tree logic and DOM manipulation

### 📚 How It Works
The user inputs a number.
The algorithm places the number according to BST rules (left < root < right).
Nodes are visually added with animation.
Search highlights the path and the target node if found.
